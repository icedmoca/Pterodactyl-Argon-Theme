## How do I use this for my Pterodactyl Panel?
The theme has a small code snippet (build.sh) that you must install into `/var/www/pterodactyl`

## Steps to install:
1. Download or make the file build.sh in the /var/www/pterodactyl dir
2. Make sure the build.sh has permissions to run `chmod +x /var/www/pterodactyl/build.sh`
3. Run the install script: if in the /var/www/pterodactyl dir run: `./build.sh`
4. Run the install script pt2, if not in the directory run `/var/www/pterodactyl/build.sh`
5. Modify the .env file `nano /var/www/pterodactyl/.env` change pterodactyltheme to `argon`
6. Run these commands after you saved the file: `php artisan theme:refresh-cache` `php artisan view:clear`
7. Refresh the browser `CTRL+F5` Success.
## FAQ:
What if this script doesn't work? A:
The implementation command will take a backup of your current panel in case anything goes wrong during the theme change! So you don't need to worry about losing anything you've already made!
